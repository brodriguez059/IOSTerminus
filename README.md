### How to compile the files

In order to compile the files, you can make use of the `compile` executable. This file expects the name of the files to be compiled (found under the `src` folder).

```bash
# compile only the main file
$ compile main

# compile cd ls and rm files
$ compile cd ls rm

# compile everything
$ make
```
