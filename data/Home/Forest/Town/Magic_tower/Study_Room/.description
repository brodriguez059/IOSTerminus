You enter a small, square shaped study room has mismatched wooden and metal furniture.  The floor is carpeted and the walls are painted and decorated with a wallpaper border.  Light is provided by wall lamps and a ceiling light.  The room is done in warm light colors and overall looks very old-fashioned.  Among the first things one notices walking in are a sturdy old wooden desk and mysterious scroll on it.
