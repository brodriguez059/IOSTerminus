You've arrived to the mountain. ItÂ´s very high (about 9000 meters), so high that looking down you can only see clouds and mist. You've lost sights of the town and be careful because you can fall off the cliff. It seems that you have reached a cave, but the entrance is blocked by a boulder (you can move the stone learning the correct spells)
