Following this tunnel you have reached another cave (east cave). Smells really bad, it's all full of viscous liquids and spiderwebs. There are many rocks, columns... all over the cave and a big hole at the middle of all the cave, and on the ground a lot of combat material (swords, shields...) with some other corpse. At the end of it, you can see like an big orc sitting on a throne. So be careful and don't make too much noise (Maybe you need a spell to throwing him into the big hole)
