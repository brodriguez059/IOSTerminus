She's a bounty hunter or monster hunter, in the village she has a reputation for being a strong person. She always wears a black cape and hat, like everything else, and if she's in town she's always in the bar. She's got a lost look and charcoal-black eyes. Legend has it that she's been the only one to face a hydra and get out alive from there.
