Welcome to Blisey: where everyone knows magic but no one will admit it.
You must be surprised that there is another sign in this kingdom. After all, for some reason everybody reads the sign of the forest first.
Well I can really say that that little and cruel sign in the forest is lying! Look at me, I am obviously another sign!
I will tell you useful information, you will see: 

* Forest: 0.3 km, go north of the town
* Mountain: 1.6 km, keep walking in west direction
* Magic Tower: 2 km, go east on the first crossing
 
'Useful information, indeed', you say
