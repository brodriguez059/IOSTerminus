My bed, or as I prefer to call it, the comfy one. Soft as the hay of the stable and warm as the fireplace. It needs some restorations as the wood is starting to lose its color, I will have to varnish it some day near...
It seems comfy but I have rest enough for today... Maybe I should explore the surroundings
