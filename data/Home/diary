Today is my birthday! Grandma has done a cheese cake specially for me it tasted tremendously good. I have to ask her the recipe and learn to make it as she makes, best cake ever!!!

Tomorrow is my birthday, I'm so excited! Grandma told me that she has prepared a special present for the occasion. Worst thing is she has not given me any clue. I don't have any idea what could it be. Also it's been long since the last time I saw her, I think it's been over a month ago...

It continues several pages, I don't feel to know more about myself now.
