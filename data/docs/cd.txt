A strange voice says:
"cd, it changes your location

This command changes current directory to the location given, if the location doesnâ€˜t exit, a custom error message is displayed. If any other errors happen unix standard error messages are shown.

To use it just write: 'cd [LOCATION]' and you will move from location."

The voice talks with a weird jargon, but you think you understood.
