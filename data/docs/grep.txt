A strange voice says:
"grep, it finds text on a file.

This commands searches the occurrence of the [needle] in each line of [item]; if a occurrence is found all the line starting on [needle] will be printed.

To use it just write: 'grep [item] [needle]' and you will interact with that item."

The voice talks with a weird jargon, but you think you understood.
