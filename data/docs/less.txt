A strange voice says:
"less, it lets you interact with items and read its contents.

This command lets you interact with the item passed and read its contents. If no item is specified, it prints a message stating that error. If the item could not be read, it would print an error message stating the reason.

To use it just write: 'less [ITEM]' and you will interact with that item."

The voice talks with a weird jargon, but you think you understood.
