A strange voice says:
"mv, it moves an item to another location

This spell moves the item [ITEM] to another directory specified in [LOCATION]. The player must always write two arguments, never less and never more.

To use it just write: 'mv [ITEM] [LOCATION]' and you will move the item".

The voice talks with a weird jargon, but you think you understood.
