A strange voice wakes you up... 

"Welcome! If you are new to the game, try these tips:

Look at your surroundings with the command "ls". 
Move to a new location with the command "cd LOCATION" 
You can backtrack with the command "cd ..". 
Interact with things in the world with the command "cat ITEM"
 
If you forget where you are, type "pwd" 

Go ahead, explore. We hope you enjoy what you find. Do ls as your first command."

You don't understand what the voice means, so you quickly ignore it. Maybe it was talking to someone else?
